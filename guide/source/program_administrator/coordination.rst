Step 2: Coordination with Trade Allies and Software Vendors
###########################################################

HPXML can be a powerful tool to facilitate trade ally/contractor choice in
software systems, while delivering consistent and reliable data. This is a
great opportunity to improve contractor satisfaction and operational
efficiency, but it is important to establish a means to collect feedback from
both your trade allies and the software community throughout the process. To
start you will want to collect feedback and cultivate support for the HPXML
goals you established in :ref:`step1`.

Trade Ally Feedback
*******************

You can use your local trade ally network, trade associations, or
energy-efficiency contracting network to facilitate this connection, focusing
specifically on your potential HPXML users. As you engage in this process, here
are a few key topic areas to collect feedback on:

* Pain points for data collection and reporting 
* Goals you are trying to achieve and how it will impact their business
* Priorities for program design and subsequent rollout
* Early adopters who can assist in testing and give feedback on initial designs
* Functionality and user experience desired from the new program software
  environment

Identifying a representative group of trade allies that can assist throughout
the process will be key in later steps of the implementation plan. Many
programs that have successfully implemented have coordinated with contractors
by: setting up regular meetings, hosting dinners to collect feedback, or
working closely with representatives from their local trade associations, such
as Efficiency First.

Software Vendor Coordination
****************************

It is important to begin communication with software vendors as soon as your
project plan is developed. BPI WG-5 can help connect you to all of the software
vendors that are currently coding to HPXML. As many of these vendors have
implemented in other jurisdictions, they offer valuable support for the
planning process.

It will be important to familiarize yourself with each of the different energy
modeling software tools that are available in the market. Each vendor takes a
different approach, which promotes innovation and helps contractors deliver
high-quality proposals and energy savings feedback to customers. That said, it
is important to understand what the market is prepared to deliver from a
software perspective and how each software tool works.  When you get to the
next step of data selection, it will be important to understand what the market
is transferring now via HPXML, and what might be a more custom request for your
jurisdiction.

Eventually, your program will have to decide on the minimum qualifications for
software to participate. By including the software vendors early on and
identifying your HPXML goals, the software vendor community and BPI WG-5 can
better assist you in setting up your software requirements. These requirements
will include being able to transfer the data you require via HPXML.

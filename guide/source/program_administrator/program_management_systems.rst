Step 4: Procuring or Modifying Program Management Systems
#########################################################

Procurement of an HPXML-compliant program management system or modification of
an existing system to be HPXML compliant is a critical juncture for every
HPXML implementation. The cost and scope of this endeavor will be largely
dictated by the business objective(s) established in :ref:`step1`, :ref:`step2` and
the data use defined in :ref:`step3`. The following section will
provide some best practice guidance for acquiring HPXML-compliant program
management software and how to use the tools provided in this guide to assist
in that process.

Build a Clear Scope
*******************

Clearly outlining your business objectives and defining the dataset you want to
use are two large steps toward building an accurate scope of work to inform your
procurement process.  Within your business objectives, you will want to
define how you want the data to work for your program. Here are some examples
of items to discuss:

  * Are you using the system to qualify projects for incentives or financing?
  * What kind of quality assurance/quality management do you want to do?

    * How much QA automation do you want to include in the system?
    * What data does your implementation team need to review on the project and
      at what stages?
    * Programs may want to reference guidance from the Home Performance with
      ENERGY STAR Sponsor Guide (v1.5). Section 6 and Appendix F provide a
      description of quality management system approach, how it uses data to
      determine compliance and measure performance, and directions for
      developing a QMS plan.

  * What is the workflow of your program?
  * What feedback systems do you want for both contractors and participating
    customers?
  * What type of program reporting are you doing?
  * Are you exporting data to third parties? If so, what are the specifications
    of their systems?

If your program needs to issue a request for proposals, there are some
additional best practices to consider:

* Include all of your program's incentive or financing rules.  This will help 
  the developers understand what pieces of information are most important to you
  and what you will be reviewing.
* Consider including narrative examples of what you are trying to accomplish 
  with this system's functionality.  Technical specifications are important, but
  adding commentary on how you want to use it is equally helpful. 
* Ask other programs to share their RFP scopes of work.  With each new program 
  adoption of HPXML, RFPs are getting more consistent and comprehensive. BPI
  WG-5 can help your procurement team identify recent RFPs and connect you with
  a program contact. 

Leverage HPXML Experience
*************************

In procuring a software provider, it is recommended that you consider their
HPXML experience — including prior implementations of HPXML and participation in
the BPI W-5.  Many software vendors have already built in HPXML compliance or
have been an active part of the HPXML process.  This experience should help
speed up implementation and can reduce costs.

There are also several program administrators that participate in BPI WG-5. If
you have questions or would like to share their experiences, please reach out by
contacting the group at hpxml@homeperformance.org.

Plan for Testing and HPXML Coordination Support
***********************************************

In your scope and timeline, leave time for testing and provide resources for
technical support in setup and integration. The amount of coordination and
testing will vary depending on your data selection and use cases. Most HPXML
programs implementations to date, have not left enough time for testing, which
can be a couple of months depending on the scope of the project. If not
accounted for in planning, this can put the project behind schedule or place a
lot of pressure on the implementation team. See the testing section below for
further guidance.

Appendix A: HPXML Tools and Resources
#####################################

A number of tool and resources exist to help software developers, programs, and other stakeholders understand the value of HPXML and how to implement the standard.

HPXML Website
*************

The Home Performance Coalition hosts a website that has information, tools, and resources on HPXML and its business cases. The website is: http://www.hpxmlonline.com.

HPXML Implementation Guide 
**************************

The `HPXML Implementation Guide <http://hpxml-guide.rtfd.org>`_ provides detailed information to programs and software developers on how to implement HPXML.  

HPXML Data Selection Tool
*************************

The :ref:`datatool` was created to assist program administrators in identifying the required data associated with HPXML use cases. The tool is a Microsoft Excel worksheet that can be downloaded from the HPXML Implementation Guide website. Users have the option of selecting one or more use cases from a dropdown menu. Once the use case(s) have been selected, the list of required fields with HPXML path will populate the sheet. 

HPXML Toolbox
*************

The `HPXML Toolbox <https://hpxml.nrel.gov>`_ provides a set of tools for software developers to validate and inspect their HPXML formatted data. Users can upload their HPXML files and check these file against the HPXML schema and its four standard datasets. The validator returns specific error messages with feedback on missing elements. There is also a searchable tree view of HPXML data to assist with navigating and inspecting errors. Validation is available through a website or an API that can be incorporated into HPXML data transfer workflows.

There is also a data dictionary for HPXML included in the Toolbox that documents the HPXML schema, the standard datasets, links to other data standards such as BEDES and RESO, and allows for searching. 

HEScore Translator
******************

The Home Energy Score Translator generates HEScore inputs from HPXML files. The translator is incorporated into the HEScore API. By using this translator, software developers can leverage their investment in HPXML to provide HESCORE functionality with minimum development cost. 

Home Upgrade Program Accelerator 
********************************

In May 2015, the DOE launched the Better Buildings Home Upgrade Program Accelerator for residential energy efficiency program administrators. This Accelerator is designed to increase the overall effectiveness of programs by leveraging data management strategies that minimize costs. The Accelerator supports the use of HPXML as a tool for achieving its goals and is working with Accelerator partners to provide assistance with adopting HPXML. 

Github
******

The working group uses `Github <https://github.com/hpxmlwg/hpxml>`_ as a forum for tracking changes to the HPXML schemas (including debating and resolving issues). The HPXML schema documentation resides on GitHub as well as links to HPXML resources.
